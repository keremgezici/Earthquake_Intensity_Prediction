I have implemented an end-to-end project of estimating the intensity of earthquakes in the eastern region of TR using machine learning algorithms. The data set was taken from Kaggle.
It includes 2290 observations. The study includes Exploratory data analysis, Feature Engineering, Machine Learning Algorithms, Hyperparameter Optimization and Stacking & Ensemble Learning sections.
